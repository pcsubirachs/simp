A simple bitcoin wallet

Built from bare bones flask architecture, this wallet is experimental only.

This wallet uses the bitcoin python library by Ofek called [Bit](https://github.com/ofek/bit).

Default mode uses the Bitcoin Testnet, where you can practice sending and receiving transactions with no risk of losing funds. 

A user can create a new wallet of their own, copy and paste the WIF into routes.py, and begin sending and receiving transactions.
